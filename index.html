        <h2>Does This Guide Apply To Me?</h2>
        <p>If you are receiving an error that looks like the image above (starts with <strong>99-</strong>, the other numbers don't matter), then ask the following three questions:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Are you playing on the JP server?</li>
          <li>Did you buy your account? Or were you given the account by someone else who might have bought it?</li>
          <li>Are you playing on <em>any</em> of the following?
            <ul>
              <li>An emulator</li>
              <li>A modified client (e.g., BFGO)</li>
              <li>An APK, even an official one, that you did not <strong>personally</strong> download <u>directly from the Google Play store</u> yourself with your own Google account?</li>
              <li>A rooted Android phone</li>
              <li>An Android phone with a custom ROM or OS (e.g., GrapheneOS)</li>
              <li>An Android phone from a region that does not bundle in Google Play Services</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>If the answer to <strong>all</strong> of those questions is "yes," then this guide is <em>probably</em> for you.</p>
        <p>If the answer to <strong>any</strong> of those questions is "no," then this guide <em>probably</em> cannot help you.</p>
        <p>For additional details on a few niche cases, see the More Details section.</p>
        <div class="callout note"><strong>NOTE</strong> — Recently (at the time of writing), Lasengle added Play Integrity code to the NA version of the game. This guide <em>might</em> become applicable to the NA server at some point.</div>

        <details>
          <summary><span class="chev" aria-hidden="true"></span> <strong>Have I Been Banned? (No, You Have Not)</strong></summary>
          <div class="content">
            <p>Error 99 is not a ban. When FGO bans a user, they send a message indicating that the user ID has been "suspended" or "found in violation of the terms of use." A banned account never simply receives a generic error message.</p>
          </div>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary><span class="chev" aria-hidden="true"></span> <strong>What Is Error 99? Why Am I Getting This Error?</strong></summary>
          <div class="content">
            <p>Error 99 is FGO's generic error code. They send it whenever an error has occurred, but they don't have a specific error code to handle the situation. In other words, Error 99 can be caused by anything.</p>
            <p>With that said, if you answered "yes" to all of the three questions above, then there is <strong>probably</strong> a certain reason for your Error 99.</p>
            <p>In October 2024, Lasengle added code to the Android version of FGO to check whether FGO is running in a "genuine" environment. It does so by querying Google's "Play Integrity API." You can learn more details about what the Play Integrity API is in the More Details section if you're curious, but basically, it checks if you're playing in an emulator, with a modified app, or any of those other things listed in the first section. It can also check whether you personally downloaded FGO from the Play Store with your own Google account.</p>
            <p>In December 2024, Lasengle began hitting some <strong><u>purchased</u></strong> accounts with Error 99 if: (1) they were being played in an environment that fails the Play Integrity API check; <strong>AND</strong> (2) they had not purchased SQ before. <u>They have continued to hit eligible accounts with this error ever since.</u> Indeed, as of August 2025, I have seen and helped hundreds of people recover their accounts, and I still see people who meet the criteria encountering this issue for the first time almost daily.</p>

          <summary><span class="chev" aria-hidden="true"></span> <strong>The Image Says "99-175..." But Mine Says "99-Something Else"</strong></summary>
          <div class="content">
            <p>A very common misconception is that the numbers after 99 mean something (e.g., that 99-174 is different than 99-175). This is not true. The numbers after the 99- are just a unix timestamp. Try writing the numbers after the 99- on <a href="https://www.epochconvert.com/">this site</a> to see for yourself. For example, the 1750080519 in the image at the top of this page is Mon, 16 Jun 2025 13:28:39 UTC.</p>

        <h2>How To Fix Error 99</h2>
        <div class="callout warn"><strong>IMPORTANT</strong> — If you read "move your account" below and think "I can't, I don't have a transfer/bind code," <strong>do not stop reading.</strong> There is a way to move your account without a code.<br><br>Also, remember, this is not a guarantee. Error 99 can be caused by anything. If you answered "yes" to the three questions in the beginning, though, there is a good chance this will fix it.</div>

        <details class="mt-6">
          <summary><span class="chev" aria-hidden="true"></span> <strong>Step 1: Move Your Account To A Passing Environment</strong></summary>
          <div class="content">
            <p>First, you'll need to move your account onto a passing environment. If you got this error on your phone after trying to use a sideloaded or modified APK, then this may just mean switching back to the official APK. If that's you, then as you'll see in the TIP below this, you can probably just start using the official APK and you may not need to do step 2.<br><br>More often, though, people who get Error 99 are playing on an emulator or a device with a custom ROM or OS. If that's you, you're going to need to get your account onto a passing "destination device."</p>
            <p><strong>Apple</strong><br/>Any iPhone or iPad supported by FGO should work as a destination device.</p>
            <p><strong>Android</strong><br/>If you're trying to use an Android device as your destination device, you can check if your Android device passes Play Integrity with <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=gr.nikolasspyr.integritycheck">Nikolas Spiridakis' Play Integrity API Checker App</a>. When you open the app, there will be three yellow circles. Click "check" below them. You want <u><strong>all three of the circles</strong></u> to turn green. If any of them are red, you should try to find a friend you trust with a phone that passes all of them.</p>
            <p>In addition to verifying that the destination Android device passes integrity, you should also make a Japanese Google Play account and download FGO directly from the Play Store. While it <em>may</em> work without taking this extra step, if it doesn't, you'll need to go through all of these steps again. Thus, to save time and hassle, you should go ahead and do it properly from the outset. On the bright side, once you do this, you'll no longer need to manage APKs or XAPKs and can simply update automatically from the Play Store. For more details on how to do this, see the Additional Resources section.</p>
            <p><strong>Both Cases</strong></p>
            <p>Regardless of whether you will be moving to an Android or Apple device, once you have a passing device that you'll be sending your account to, you need to actually send it over. If you have a transfer code, great—you can use your transfer code to transfer it to that device. If you don't have one, please continue reading: there is an alternative method. For details on how to transfer your account without a transfer code, see the Additional Resources section. Note as well that if your sole issue is using a sideloaded APK on a device that <u>otherwise</u> passes integrity, you just need to transfer your account to a directly downloaded APK.</p>
          </div>
        </details>

        <div class="callout tip mt-6"><strong>TIP</strong> — If you don't mind playing on the passing environment you transferred to, you can stop here. If you want to return your account to the <em>failing</em> environment, then you need to proceed to step 2.</div>

        <details class="mt-6">
          <summary><span class="chev" aria-hidden="true"></span> <strong>Step 2: Buy Some Amount Of SQ</strong></summary>
          <div class="content">
            <p>Once you've successfully moved your account to the passing environment, you should be able to log in. However, if you move your account back to the failing environment, you will get Error 99 again. Lasengle does not enforce Play Integrity against accounts that have purchased SQ before. Thus, to prevent Error 99 from returning, you need to buy SQ. Any amount, even the smallest possible amount, will work. For help purchasing SQ outside of Japan, see the Additional Resources section.</p>
            <p>Once you've purchased SQ, you're free to spend it and you can move your account back to an emulator, custom ROM, modified APK, or other environment of your choice.</p>

        <details>
          <summary><span class="chev" aria-hidden="true"></span> <strong>How Do I Move My Account Without A Transfer Code?</strong></summary>
          <div class="content">
            <p>The way to do this is to move your account files directly. First, you'll need to download some sort of file manager on the <u><strong>emulator / failing device</strong></u>. For simplicity, I recommend downloading <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.marc.files">this app</a>, which is just a shortcut to the hidden built‑in Android system file explorer. There are other file explorers that work, but the system one has the best chance. Note that the system explorer is not necessarily the same as the stock one (e.g., on a Samsung phone, the system explorer is not the same as Samsung's files app). Not all file explorers support exploring the folder that we will need to access.</p>
            <p>Once you have your file explorer, you'll need to find your account files. These will be located in <code>Android/data/com.aniplex.fategrandorder/files/data</code>. <strong>Be careful.</strong> Make sure you are in <code>com.aniplex.fategrandorder</code> and <u><strong>not</strong></u> in <code>com.aniplex.fategrandorder<u><strong>.en</strong></u></code>. If it ends in <code>.en</code>, then you're looking at the NA application, not the JP application.</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/fgoaccountfiles.jpg" alt="Image of FGO Files" width="720" height="406" />
            </figure>
            <p>You'll want to copy four files beginning with <code>54cc</code>, <code>969b</code>, <code>644b</code>, <code>e1a9</code>. Strictly speaking, only <code>54cc</code> is actually necessary, but it's a good idea to copy these four just to make sure things go smoothly. Put these files somewhere easy to access, but if you're using an emulator, you'll want to get them out of your emulator. The steps for that will depend on what emulator you are using.</p>
            <p>Once you have your account files, you'll need to take steps to move them based on what type of device your destination device is.</p>

              <summary><span class="chev" aria-hidden="true"></span> <strong>I'm Moving To An Android Device</strong></summary>
              <div class="content">
                <p>In that case, it's straightforward. By this point, you should have already downloaded your (ideally official, direct from the store) FGO app on your destination device. Now you just need to go into the same location on your destination device, <code>Android/data/com.aniplex.fategrandorder/files/data</code> (make sure it's not <code>.en</code>), and paste in the four files you copied from your failing environment. You can download and use the same file manager app to do it that you used to get the files on your failing environment. Then, start up FGO and you'll be automatically logged in.</p>

                <p>I do not use iOS personally, so this information comes from (1) a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/grandorder/comments/hfbz0h/comment/fw1ln24">Reddit post by King_Cabbage and the various replies beneath it</a>; (2) <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/itunes/back-up-your-iphone-ipad-or-ipod-touch-itns3280/windows">Apple's</a> and <a href="https://imazing.com/guides/how-to-edit-iphone-ipad-backup">iMazing's</a> documentation; and (3) my recent experience of helping a couple people on iOS restore their account (successfully).</p>

                <p><strong><u style="font-size: 20px;">Step 1: Rename The Four Files You Saved Earlier</u></strong><br/>Unlike Android, iOS uses plaintext file names for its data files. To prepare the files you took from your failing environment for use with iOS, you'll need to rename them. If you ever want to move these files back to Android, you'll need to rename them again back to the Android versions.</p>

                <p>To make sure it worked, click Edit &gt; Preferences, then click Devices. Make sure your backup is listed.</p>
                <p><strong><u style="font-size: 20px;">Step 3: Edit the Backup with iMazing</u></strong><br/>Next, download the <a href="https://imazing.com/">iMazing</a> app.</p>
                <figure>
                  <img src="images/ios instructions/imazing.jpg" alt="iMazing" width="720" height="406" />
                </figure>
                <p>Your backup should be listed under "Backups," but if it isn't, then you may need to go to <code>\Users\USERNAME\Apple\MobileSync\Backup</code> and drag the backup into iMazing.</p>
                <p>Next, open your backup in iMazing and navigate to the <code>com.aniplex.fategrandorder</code> folder (make sure it's not <code>.en</code>).</p>
                <figure>
                  <img src="images/ios instructions/imazing fgo.png" alt="iMazing FGO" width="720" height="406" />
                </figure>
                <p>Go to the "Documents" folder inside the FGO app.</p>
                <figure>
                  <img src="images/ios instructions/imazing fgo documents.png" alt="iMazing FGO Documents" width="720" height="406" />
                </figure>
                <p>Then, delete the authsave.dat, authsave2.dat, signupsave.dat, and friendcodesave.dat files and replace them with the ones you saved from your failing environment using the "Delete" and "Copy to Backup" buttons towards the bottom of the screen. It may ask you to make an editable backup first. If so, do it and make sure to give it a recognizable name to distinguish it.</p>
                <p><strong><u style="font-size: 20px;">Step 4: Prepare the Edited Backup for Restoration</u></strong><br/></p>
                <p>If you have iMazing's premium version, you should be able to restore directly from iMazing, and can even limit the restore to just FGO. If you don't, though, then you'll need to prepare the backup to restore through iTunes.</p>
                <p>First, click the "overview" button in your edited backup in iMazing.</p>
                  <figure>
                    <img src="images/ios instructions/overview button.png" alt="Overview button in iMazing" width="720" height="436" />
                  </figure>
                  <p>Next, click "show in File Explorer."</p>
                  <figure>
                    <img src="images/ios instructions/show in explorer.png" alt="Show in explorer button in iMazing" width="720" height="436" />
                  </figure>
                  <p>This will take you to the iMazing backup in File Explorer. It should be full of two-character named folders. You need to move out one folder higher, as shown in the image below.</p>
                  <figure>
                    <img src="images/ios instructions/filesystem.png" alt="The backup directory." width="720" height="436" />
                  </figure>
                  <p>You should see a folder with just one subfolder that looks like a date and time. Copy this folder.</p>
                  <figure>
                    <img src="images/ios instructions/filesystem2.png" alt="The folder to copy" width="720" height="436" />
                  </figure>
                  <p>Next, you'll need to return to your iTunes backup directory. Remember, that's <code>\Users\USERNAME\Apple\MobileSync\Backup</code>. There, you should see the iMazing folder as well as a folder with a long name; that's your iTunes backup you took earlier. You want to paste the iMazing backup you copied into this folder, alongside the other two.</p>
                  <figure>
                    <img src="images/ios instructions/filesystem3.png" alt="Where to Paste iMazing backup" width="720" height="436" />
                  </figure>
                  <p>Once you've done so, you should see something like this:</p>
                  <figure>
                    <img src="images/ios instructions/filesystem4.png" alt="Pasted iMazing backup" width="720" height="436" />
                  </figure>
                <p><strong><u style="font-size: 20px;">Step 5: Restore the Edited Backup</u></strong></p>
                <p>Finally, go back to iTunes and restore the edited backup The restore button should now be available in the same place you backed up before.</p>
                <figure>
                  <img src="images/ios instructions/restore.png" alt="Restore in iTunes" width="720" height="436" />
                </figure>
                <p>If you moved the iMazing backup correctly, it should ask you to choose your device name, and one of the options should be the edited backup that you made and gave a recognizable name. Restore that backup.</p>

              <p><strong><u>Making a Japanese Google Play Account</u></strong></p>
              <p><strong>Step 1: Get a Free VPN with a Japanese Server</strong></p>
              <p>The first step is to get a VPN that has an option to tunnel to Japan. There are several free options available, and you'll only need it once. I like <a href="https://protonvpn.com/">ProtonVPN</a> personally. Once you've created your account, use the VPN to tunnel to Japan on your phone.</p>
              <p><strong>Step 2: Create the Google Account</strong></p>
              <p>By creating a Google Account using an Android smartphone, you can generally bypass the phone number requirement.<br>Go to your phone's settings app, and navigate to Accounts → Manage Accounts. Click "add account" at the bottom and select Google. Set the region to Japan, and fill in your desired new account information.</p>
              <p><strong>Step 3: Clear Data and Log in to Google Play</strong></p>
              <p>Next, go to Settings → Apps → Google Play and clear all of its data and cache. You may need to click "Storage" on the app page to clear its contents.<br>Finally, open up the Google Play Store and log in to the new account you created. Search Fate Grand Order and the Japanese version should appear. Once you install it, you can then log back into your normal Google Play account and turn off your VPN. In the future, you can update (or auto update) directly from Google Play using the Japanese account, even without the VPN.</p>
              <br><p><strong><u>Making a Japanese Payment Profile</u></strong></p>
              <p><strong>Step 1: Create a Profile</strong></p>
              <p>First, turn your VPN back on for this step. Navigate to <a href="https://pay.google.com/gp/w/home/settings">your account's Payment Profile Settings</a> and login to your Japanese Google Play Account. Either create your first payment profile, or if you already have one, create a second payment profile using the pencil icon next to Country/Region. Set the region to Japan, and enter a Japanese address. You may need to change your payment profile to the newly created one first if you already had one.</p>
              <p><strong>Step 2: Adding Payment Information</strong></p>
              <p>At this point, you can either add your card information with the Japanese address to your payment method on the current page you are on, OR you can go to <a href="https://play.google.com/store/paymentmethods">your Payment Methods Settings</a> to add a PayPal account.</p>

        <details>
          <summary><span class="chev" aria-hidden="true"></span> <strong>More Details On The Play Integrity API</strong></summary>
          <div class="content">
            <p>Google's <a href="https://developer.android.com/google/play/integrity">Play Integrity API</a> is Google's way of letting app developers check whether their app is running in a "genuine" (Google-certified) environment or not. When a developer wants to check integrity (such as when you open their app), they will send a request for an "integrity verdict" from Google Play Services. Google Play Services will collect details about your environment using privileged, tamper-proof methods (such as hardware-backed attestation), cryptographically sign it (to prevent tampering in transit), and return a response with a range of information, including a <a href="https://developer.android.com/google/play/integrity/verdicts">verdict on whether your environment passes the check</a>.</p>
            <p>The returned response will usually be either: blank (failure), <code>MEETS_BASIC_INTEGRITY</code>, or <code>MEETS_STRONG_INTEGRITY</code>. There are a couple of other possible responses, but they are not relevant here. You can see more about what each verdict entails in the documentation linked above. Some people seem to have gotten through with <code>BASIC_INTEGRITY</code>, but you should aim for <code>STRONG_INTEGRITY</code> if you're following this guide to fix your Error‑99‑afflicted account.</p>
            <p>You might wonder why emulators cannot be made to pass. That is because Google doesn't <em>want</em> them to pass. In order for devices to pass Play Integrity, Google has to certify them. If Google does not certify them, they can never pass.</p>
            <p>You may also wonder about <a href="https://play.google.com/googleplaygames/">Google Play Games for PC</a>, Google's own emulator. There are two versions of this emulator, the developer edition and the consumer edition. The developer edition allows you to install any app you want. This version fails integrity outright. The consumer edition only allows certain apps explicitly designed to be played on this emulator. FGO is not available. In any event, the consumer edition sends a special code <code>MEETS_VIRTUAL_INTEGRITY</code> response. This requires developers to explicitly treat it as a pass in their code. Thus, even if you could somehow get FGO onto the consumer edition, it would fail integrity because Lasengle has likely not added support for this special response.</p>
            <p>One additional, newer ability of the Play Integrity API is to check <a href="https://developer.android.com/google/play/integrity/verdicts#account-details-field">whether users have installed an app directly from the store</a>. When a user downloads an app from the Google Play Store, the store embeds signing metadata into the app, which the OS can later verify. A developer can request a Play Integrity Response that can return one of a few verdicts. A verdict will return <code>LICENSED</code> if the user <strong>personally</strong> downloaded the app themselves through the Google Play Store on their own device. It will return <code>UNLICENSED</code> if the user downloaded the app through any other means, even if they got it from someone else who downloaded it directly from Google Play. It will return <code>UNEVALUATED</code> if the device isn't trustworthy enough to believe the response, the user is not signed in to Google Play, or if, for any other reason, Google is unable to check.</p>
            <p>For much more detail on the Play Integrity API and examples of what responses look like, refer to Google's official documentation.</p>

          <summary><span class="chev" aria-hidden="true"></span> <strong>More Details On "Eligible" Accounts / How Does Lasengle Know My Account Was Purchased / What If I Bought From My Friend?</strong></summary>
          <div class="content">
            <p>Elsewhere in this guide, I mention that one of the criteria to receive Error 99 is that your account is purchased. This is mostly true and covers most situations I see in practice, but it is not technically precise. Lasengle does not know that you purchased your account from someone.</p>
            <p>The actual thing that Lasengle looks for is a certain type of bot involvement with your account, and there is a certain signal that gives it away to Lasengle. I am being intentionally vague here because I do not want to make it easier for account sellers to bypass what the actual check is. Even if this check is met, however, they still only take action on the account if it is being played in an environment that fails integrity and if it has not purchased SQ before. In other words, they're trying to prevent account sellers from mass‑creating accounts, leveling and maintaining them programmatically or in environments that aren't legitimate user phones, and stockpiling SQ to sell as an SQ account.</p>
            <p>The reason why I say that this targets "purchased" accounts is because most account sellers use bots to create and maintain their accounts. Thus, most of them fall under the botted category that tips Lasengle off. However, (1) a botted account that was never purchased is eligible to be hit; and (2) an account purchased from someone, like a friend, who made and played their account themselves for its entire existence, no bots involved, <u><strong>is not eligible to be hit</strong></u>.</p>

          <summary><span class="chev" aria-hidden="true"></span> <strong>It's Possible To Spoof Play Integrity On A Rooted Emulator, Right?</strong></summary>
          <div class="content">
            <p>In limited ways—but this is not recommended. There are multiple levels of integrity (see the section on Play Integrity). Generally, you can only spoof the weaker one. That might be enough for FGO for now, but it is not a sustainable solution.</p>
            <p>There is also a way to spoof strong integrity, but it works by either using leaked keys that Google actively bans, or forwarding integrity requests to a sort of device farm for approval. This is a fragile approach and likely to break. Finally, if I recall correctly, FGO doesn't like rooted devices anyway, so even if you ignore the other warnings, you might also have to hide your root status.</p>
            <p>In any event, Google frequently strengthens integrity and actively seeks to break exploits. Spoofing integrity is not a solution to this problem.</p>
